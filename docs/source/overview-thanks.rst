This project reflects many insightful discussions with members of the data science + pydata community, especially the developers of Spark and PySpark, the coding sprint team on the spylearn project, the developers of sparkit-learn, Matt Rocklin (and the Dask project), and Stephan Hoyer (and the x-ray project).
